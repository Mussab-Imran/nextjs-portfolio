              As an Open-Source Research Specialist, I conduct comprehensive intelligence research on persons of interest, 
              analyzing publicly available data to assess potential risks and compliance issues. I develop detailed reports 
              that align with organizational objectives, highlighting key information and providing actionable insights for 
              senior management and stakeholders. To enhance research efficiency, I design and maintain custom applications 
              and tools that streamline operations, automate repetitive tasks, and improve data accuracy. Additionally, 
              I prepare and distribute daily newsletters and press summaries, ensuring that senior leadership and colleagues 
              are informed with the latest developments and pertinent information to support critical decision-making processes.

              I led the revamp of websites across the Engineering and Biological Sciences departments 
              to achieve AODAâ€™s AA conformance rating, improving accessibility compliance from 60% to 95%. 
              This work involved updating sites built with WordPress, PHP, and HTML. To streamline repetitive tasks, 
              I developed a Python script for automated adjustments. Additionally, I created PowerApps integrated with 
              SharePoint to optimize departmental workflows and support daily operations effectively.

              Collaborated with my team to redesign and implement a client's case management system. 
              Conducted research to identify pain points in the existing system and worked closely with 
              the client to develop iterative prototypes using JustInMind. Once the prototype was finalized, 
              I developed the solution using Angular, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Docker. Worked in an Agile 
              environment to ensure continuous feedback, user testing, and iteration, delivering a system aligned 
              with client goals and optimized for functionality.
